# Project Context

This project was completed as part of an assignment for my Business Application Programming course at Florida International University. The goal was to analyze a dataset using Python and create three visualizations in Google Colab.

I used AI tools to help refine my code, improve the clarity of my visualizations and guide my analysis process. All coding decisions and interpretation of the results were done by me.

# Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- AI tools for guidance and refinement
- Kaggle dataset
